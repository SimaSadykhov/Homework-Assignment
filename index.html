   <p>Halloweekend is one of the top three “party” holidays for kids, teenagers, and adults, of the year. It is the sixth U.S. holiday to have a high number of 9-1-1 calls and complaints. With many different reasons for complaints, noise complaints were one of the highest complaints on the last day of Halloweekend this year. 
    Brooklyn had the most noise complaints out of all five boroughs this year with the Bronx coming in second, Manhattan coming in third, Queens in fourth, and Staten Island with the least complaints. The biggest noise complaint from all five boroughs was loud music and partying. Given that many people celebrate Halloween, it was interesting to see these calls being made on a Sunday night, usually before a work or school day.
    All noise complaints that night were marked resolved, according to NYC Open Data. Regardless of the complaints, Halloween will remain one of the biggest party holidays in the U.S. </p>
